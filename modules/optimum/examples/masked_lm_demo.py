# Use OpenVINO for Masked Language Modeling
#
# This demo shows how to use openvino-optimum with a PyTorch Fill-Mask model
# from https://huggingface.co/models
#
# The code demonstrates how to load a model from the Hugging Face Model Hub
# and do inference with OpenVINO. Model conversion and inference with
# OpenVINO is handled by openvino-optimum in the background.
#
# To run this model, please install openvino-optimum[all]
# (see https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_contrib/blob/master/modules/optimum/README.md )
# and PyTorch. The demo is tested with torch==1.9.1.
#
# NOTE: openvino-optimum initializes the model on first inference, so the first inference
#       is expected to take longer.

# Load OpenVINO model from PyTorch
# If the model has not been downloaded before, it will be downloaded from
# the Hugging Face Model Hub. openvino-optimum will convert the model to ONNX
# in the background.
